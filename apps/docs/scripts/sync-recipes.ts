    `## Recipe notes

This is the baseline setup for repositories that want one trusted review path before adding specialist tasks. It uses \`pipr.review\`, so Pipr wires the change request and command entrypoints for you; local \`pipr review\` runs the same change-request task.

- Keep \`inlineComments.max\` low until the repository has enough review history to judge signal quality.
- Put repository-specific review policy in \`instructions\`, not in ad hoc task code.
- Add path filters only after you know which files should never receive inline findings.
`,
  ],
  [
    "bug-hunter",
    `## Recipe notes

Bug Hunter narrows review to likely defects and excludes Markdown/docs paths by default. It also declares a fallback model profile so transient or invalid output failures can retry without changing the task.

- Expand \`paths.exclude\` for generated files, snapshots, vendored code, or fixtures that produce noisy findings.
- Keep the command entrypoint \`@pipr bugs\` for manual reruns on risky PRs that did not need a full review.
- Tune the reviewer instructions around the bug classes your project actually sees: data loss, race conditions, migrations, API compatibility, or missed tests.
`,
  ],
  [
    "security-sast",
    `## Recipe notes

Security SAST uses a custom JSON Schema output instead of the default review schema. The task turns high and critical risks into a failed check and publishes only findings that include validated diff ranges.

- Keep severity rules concrete so the check fails only for risks with a plausible attack path.
- Add project-specific categories when the repository has important trust boundaries, such as tenant isolation, billing, or auth scopes.
- Treat this as pull-request SAST over changed code, not a replacement for dependency advisories or whole-repo scanners.
`,
  ],
  [
    "quality-gate",
    `## Recipe notes

Quality Gate makes Pipr part of the merge decision by publishing a required check. It also enables aggregate checks and tighter auto-resolve behavior for follow-up review state.

- Use this only when the reviewer instructions are strict enough to report merge-blocking issues rather than nice-to-have cleanup.
- Align the required check name with your branch protection rule before rolling it out broadly.
- Raise or lower \`publication.maxInlineComments\` based on how much blocking feedback maintainers can act on in one PR.
`,
  ],
  [
    "diff-diagnostics",
    `## Recipe notes

Diff Diagnostics models reviewdog-style output: the agent emits diagnostics, then the task maps each diagnostic into a Pipr \`ReviewFinding\`. This is useful when you want a custom intermediate schema but still need normal inline review comments.

- Keep the diagnostic schema small and deterministic so invalid-output repair stays cheap.
- Use \`suggestedFix\` only when the replacement is exact for the selected range.
- Add path filters to \`ctx.change.diffManifest(...)\` when diagnostics should apply to only one language or subsystem.
`,
  ],
  [
    "pr-hygiene",
    `## Recipe notes

PR Hygiene reviews the shape of the pull request: tests, docs, lockfiles, generated files, and size. It reads both \`changedFiles\` and the Diff Manifest so it can reason about file-level signals and changed code.

- Customize the instructions with your repository's release-note, migration, generated-code, and test expectations.
- Keep the check non-required until maintainers agree which hygiene findings should block merge.
- Add explicit allowlists for common mechanical changes, such as formatter-only PRs or dependency lockfile refreshes.
`,
  ],
  [
    "dependency-risk",
    `## Recipe notes

Dependency Risk scopes the Diff Manifest to package manifests and lockfiles before running the model. If no dependency files changed, the task exits with a short main comment instead of spending model time.

- Extend the include list for ecosystem-specific files, such as Helm charts, Docker base images, or Terraform provider locks.
- Ask for migration notes when your project frequently upgrades frameworks or runtime major versions.
- Do not rely on this recipe for live vulnerability lookup; the default prompt only claims risks visible in the diff.
`,
  ],
  [
    "ci-triage-command",
    `## Recipe notes

CI Triage is command-only. Maintainers paste the relevant log excerpt into \`@pipr ci <log...>\`, and Pipr replies in the command thread using the log, prior Pipr review state, and the current Diff Manifest.

- Keep the pasted log short enough to include the failing command, error, and nearby stack trace.
- Add CI-provider conventions to the instructions, such as test shard naming, cache keys, or known flaky suites.
- Keep the command permission at \`write\` if CI logs may contain internal paths, environment names, or deployment details.
`,
  ],
  [
    "multi-agent-review",
    `## Recipe notes

Multi-agent Review runs specialist agents for security, tests, and maintainability, then asks an aggregator to dedupe and publish one review. This costs more model work than the default recipe but gives each specialist a narrower job.

- Use it for larger or riskier repositories where one broad prompt misses important review dimensions.
- Keep specialist prompts independent, then put dedupe and prioritization rules in the aggregator.
- Watch timeout and token limits after adding specialists; each additional agent consumes a separate Pi run.
`,
  ],
  [
    "plugin-tool-review",
    `## Recipe notes

Plugin Tool Review demonstrates a typed Pipr plugin with R2-backed memory tools. The reviewer can call \`r2_memory_search\` while reviewing, and \`r2_memory_store\` is available for explicit customization when you decide what memory is safe to persist.

- Start with search-only reviewer behavior; add store calls only for curated, non-sensitive project knowledge.
- Keep the R2 bucket shared only when repository-scoped prefixes are acceptable for your organization.
- Add more plugin tools when the agent needs stable project context that should not be copied into every prompt.
`,
  ],
  [
    "pr-briefing",
    `## Recipe notes

PR Briefing is intentionally not a defect hunt. It disables inline comments and publishes a main-comment overview with change summary, risk framing, and a small walkthrough.

- Use this for repositories where reviewers first need orientation, not another blocking check.
- Keep the command permission at \`read\` when the briefing does not expose extra private systems.
- Replace the sample Mermaid block with repository-specific sections if maintainers prefer checklists, rollout notes, or ownership hints.
`,
  ],
  [
    "interactive-ask",
    `## Recipe notes

Interactive Ask is a read-permission command for maintainer questions. It answers from the current diff, prior Pipr review state, and bounded runtime context, and it should say when the answer needs external systems.

- Keep this separate from normal review so maintainers can ask follow-up questions without triggering new inline comments.
- Tighten the prompt if your team wants answers in a fixed format, such as risks, tests to run, or files to inspect.
- Raise command permission to \`write\` if answers could expose sensitive repository context.
`,
  ],
  [
    "changelog-draft",
    `## Recipe notes

Changelog Draft asks for one structured release-note entry and rationale. It publishes a comment only; it does not edit changelog files.

- Adjust the category enum to match your changelog taxonomy before relying on the output.
- Use it on release-facing repositories where maintainers routinely rewrite PR descriptions into notes.
- Keep the task comment-only unless you also add a separate, reviewed workflow for file edits.

{/* This file is generated by apps/docs/scripts/sync-recipes.ts. */}

Recipes are checked-in starter configs for common review workflows. They are generated from Pipr's official runtime recipe registry, so the code shown here matches what \`pipr init\` writes.

\`\`\`bash
pipr init --recipe security-sast
pipr check
\`\`\`

Use \`pipr init\` without \`--recipe\` for the default review setup.

## Common setup

\`pipr init\` also writes \`.pipr/tsconfig.json\` and \`.pipr/types/**\` with generated Pipr SDK declarations for editor IntelliSense. These files are optional for CI and the GitHub Action; \`pipr check\` can synthesize the same SDK type support when they are missing.

\`\`\`bash
pipr init --recipe security-sast --no-types
pipr init --types-only
\`\`\`

Pipr config and plugin files execute in Bun, so \`.pipr/*.ts\` files can use the Bun API directly, including imports such as \`import { S3Client } from "bun"\`.

## Common tuning

- Change the model provider and \`apiKey\` secret name before committing the config.
- Run \`pipr inspect\` after edits to confirm models, tasks, commands, and tools.
- Use \`--adapters none\` when you want only the \`.pipr\` config files.
- Use a local run before opening a pull request when the recipe adds custom commands or tasks.
- Tune instructions first, then limits. Runtime limits are guardrails; prompts decide what the reviewer considers actionable.
